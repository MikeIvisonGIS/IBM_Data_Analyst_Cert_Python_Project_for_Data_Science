# IBM_Data_Analyst_Cert_Python_Project_for_Data_Science
Contains deliverables that were created as part of the Python Project for Data Science course that is part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate.

The project compares stock information from Tesla and Gamestop from ~2010-2021.

### The deliverables include:

1) IBM_Cert_Python_Project_Final_Assignment.ipynb
2) tesla_revenue_graph.html
3) gme_revenue_graph.html
4-9) Result sreenshots

### Items 2 and 3 are interactive plots and can be viewed using the links below:

Tesla Revenue - https://mikeivisongis.github.io/docs/tesla_revenue_graph.html

Gamestop Revenue - https://mikeivisongis.github.io/docs/gme_revenue_graph.html

### As a rough guideline, I followed the steps below:

1) Create a jupyter notebook, install/import all required Python modules/libraries
2) Use the python module yfinance to locate stock information about Tesla and Gamestop.
3) Use Requests and BeautifulSoup to webscrape/parse table information.
4) Use plotly to create a stock graph.
